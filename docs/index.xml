      <description>Birthdate: 1 Jan 1920
Place: Rakovnik, Czechoslovakia
Hanka Svarc was born in Rakovnik near Prague, Czechoslovakia. Her parents owned and operated a retail business, her father having worked his way up from apprenticeÂ­ship. Hanka remembers the family as not being particularly religious but they did observe the Jewish holidays and calendar. Relations were good with the non-Jewish locals and at that time in her life as a young woman she did not feel or think of herself as different from her non-Jewish friends because of her religion.</description>
